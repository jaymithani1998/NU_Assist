We styled the web pages with navbars, caurosels, accordians, and cards.The project includes features such as the ability to phone or email the restaurant or accommodation sites straight from the website.The website features reviews at the bottom of the page; these are the genuine reviews; the name and profile have been substituted with fictitious names. It features all of the grocery or food stores near the university, as well as several safe and well-known spots among students where the bulk of students live, as well as links to accommodation-finding websites that will assist students.
